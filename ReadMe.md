# Personalized Intervention for Alcohol Consumption

## Description

This project was designed to raise awareness of the alcohol consumption problem in the world and to protect people from the harmful effects of alcohol. This is an innovative project, as the solution produced by the project against the alcohol problem is supported by the skills of artificial intelligence. In this project, an artificial intelligence model that detects alcohol consumption using blood values and some physical data taken from individuals is coded in Python language. Thanks to this model, the Ministry of Health, which has citizens' data, can identify citizens who consume alcohol and provide specific guidance directly to the person according to the problems in their bodies.

## Files
- smoking_drinking_dataset.zip : Includes the data set consisting of 991346 rows
- project_process.ipynb : Source code containing the creation process (all codes) of the model
- final_model.ipynb : Source code containing the final version of the model
- ReadMe.md  

## How to run?

Make sure the dataset is in the same directory as the source code files.

### 1.Viewing the creation process of the model
Run the project_process.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

### 2.Running the model directly 
Run final_model.ipynb from Jupyter Notebook.
